Intelligent  Customer  Help  Desk  With  Smart  Document Understanding
Category : Artificial  Intelligence
Project  Scope  Document :

1. Project  Summary :
    In  this  project, we  use  the  typical  customer  care  chatbot  experience, but  instead  of  relying  on  pre-determined  responses, the  dialog  provides  a  hook  that   can  call  out  to  other  IBM  Watson  services  for  additional  sources  of  information. In  this  case, its  an  owner  manual  that  has  been  uploaded  to  Watson  Discovery.

2. Project  Requirements :
i) Create  a  customer  care  dialog  skill  in  Watson  Assistant.
ii) Smart  Document  Understanding (SDU)  to  build  an  enhanced  Watson  Discovery  collection.
iii) Create  an  IBM  Cloud  functions  web  action  that  allows  Watson  Assistant  to  post  queries  to  Watson  discovery.
iv) Build  a  web  application  with  integration  to  all  these  services  and  deploy  the  same  on  IBM  Cloud  Platform.

3. Functional  Requirements:

step-1: The  data  source  from  external  is  annotated  by  using  Watson  Discovery  Smart  Document  Understanding.
step-2: The  user  interacts  with  the  back-end  server  through  the  application  user  interface. The  front-end  app  user  interface  is  a  chatbot  that  engages  the  user  in  a  conversaton.
step-3: Dialog  between  the  user  and  back-end  server is  coordinated  using  a  Watson  Assistant  dialog  skill.
step-4: If  the  user  asks  a  question  that  falls  outside  of  the  scope  of  the  pre-determined  question  set, then  a  search  query  is  issued  to  the  Watson  Discovery  service  through  a  Watson  Assistant  search  skill.

4. Technical  Requirements :
i) write  the  code  in  github  account  and  clone  the  repository.
ii) Create  Watson  services.
iii) Configure  Watson  Discovery.
iv) Configure  Watson  Assistant.
v) Add  Watson  service  credentials  to  environment  file.
vi) Run  the  application.

5. Software  Requirements:
