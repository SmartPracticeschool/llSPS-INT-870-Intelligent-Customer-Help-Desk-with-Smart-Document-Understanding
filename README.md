# Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

## Category : Artificial  Intelligence

In this project, we go through a working example of a web ui that utilises multiple Watson services to create a better customer care experience.

Using the Watson Discovery Smart Document Understanding (SDU) feature, we will enhance the Discovery model so that queries will be better focused to only search the most relevant information found in a typical owner's manual. When a customer question involves operation of a product, the Assistant dialog will communicate with the Discovery service using a webhook.

The webhook will be created by defining a web action using IBM Cloud Functions.

### What is SDU ?


### 3. Functional  Requirements:

step-1: The  data  source  from  external  is  annotated  by  using  Watson  Discovery Smart  Document  Understanding.

step-2: The  user  interacts  with  the  back-end  server  through  the  application  user  interface. The  front-end  app  user  interface  is  a  chatbot  that  engages  the  user  in  a  conversaton.

step-3: Dialog  between  the  user  and  back-end  server is  coordinated  using  a  Watson  Assistant  dialog  skill.

step-4: If  the  user  asks  a  question  that  falls  outside  of  the  scope  of  the  pre-determined  question  set, then  a  search  query  is  issued  to  the  Watson  Discovery  service  through  a  Watson  Assistant  search  skill.

### 4. Technical  Requirements :

i) write  the  code  in  github  account  and  clone  the  repository.

ii) Create  Watson  services.

iii) Configure  Watson  Discovery.

iv) Configure  Watson  Assistant.

v) Add  Watson  service  credentials  to  environment  file.

vi) Run  the  application.
